*inofficial release*

*Current version:* 0.5.0-SNAPSHOT

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

This module provides infrastructure components to build repository abstractions for stores dealing with the
https://www.eclipse.org/cdo/[*Connected Data Objects (CDO) model repository*].

== Getting Started

The standard use case is to store and read native `CDOObjects` and `EObjects`.
To be clear, the framework doesn't perform a transformation of standard Java POJOs to Ecore representatives.
That would imply the generation of dynamic EMF models.
Only native CDO objects or standard EObjects (and in legacy mode) are supported.
Legacy mode: Models that are not converted for CDO support.
See also https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDO/Preparing_EMF_Models[Preparing EMF Models]

Domain models should be defined using Eclipse EMF as usual.
Then, domain classes can be created automatically.
They can be used afterwards with *Spring Data CDO*.

=== Getting Started: Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-cdo</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

And include the required repository:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
        <id>STFactory</id>
        <name>st-tu-dresden-artifactory</name>
        <url>https://stgroup.jfrog.io/artifactory/st-tu-dresden-maven-repository/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

=== Example

The following examples show some possible configurations and usage scenarios.

==== Domain classes

The framework works with native EMF models:

[source,java]
----
// any auto-generated EMF model or native CDO model
interface Person extends EObject {}
interface Person extends CDOObject {}
----

Non-native EMF domain classes (i.e., classes that don't extend `EObject` or the `CDOObject` interface) should be annotated in the following way to provide necessary details:

[source,java]
----
@CDO(path = "your/repository/resource/path",
        nsUri = "http://www.example.org/personDomainModel",
        ePackage = PersonDomainModelPackage.class,
        ePackageBaseClass = "org.example.ecore.personDomainModel.PersonDomainModelPackage"
)
class PersonWrapper {
    @Id
    CDOID id;
    @EObjectModel(classFor=Person.class)
    public Person model;
}
----

They effectively work like a wrapper for internal members, which are of class `EObject` or `CDOObject`.
Additionally, an ID must be specified of type `CDOID` using the `@Id` annotation feature of Spring.

==== Repository Definition

[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface PersonRepository extends CdoRepository<PersonWrapper, CDOID> {
}
----

==== Some Remarks

With regard to EMF-related programming, the respective `EPackage` must be registered in the global package registry first (see https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/emf/javadoc/2.9.0/[EPackage.Registry]).
The registry provides a mapping from namespace URIs to `EPackage` instances.

> Though, this framework has some internal mechanism to initialize the EPackage in the registry automatically, it may not always find it.

We advise to initialize the corresponding `EPackage` that is going to be used with this framework by using standard mechanisms of EMF:

[source,java]
----
    @BeforeClass
    public static void beforeClass() throws Exception {
        PersonDomainModelPackageImpl.init();
        // Or: EPackage.Registry.INSTANCE.put("http://www.example.org/personDomainModel", PersonDomainModelPackage.eINSTANCE);

        // This statement should not fail:
        EPackage ePackage = EPackage.Registry.INSTANCE.getEPackage("http://www.example.org/personDomainModel");
        Assert.notNull(ePackage, "Model Package couldn't be found in the EPackage Registry.");
    }
----

Especially when working with CDO the package should be registered locally and remotely:

[source,java]
----
CdoTemplate template = new CdoTemplate(factory);
CDOPackageRegistry.INSTANCE.put(BookstoreDomainModelPackage.eNS_URI, BookstoreDomainModelPackage.eINSTANCE);
CDOPackageRegistry remoteRegistry = template.getCDOPackageRegistry(); //acquire the remote CDO package registry
EPackage ePackage = remoteRegistry.getEPackage(BookstoreDomainModelPackage.eNS_URI);
if (ePackage == null) {
    remoteRegistry.put(BookstoreDomainModelPackage.eNS_URI, BookstoreDomainModelPackage.eINSTANCE);
}
----

=== Events

When required, one can listen to specific events emitted by some repository actions for adding extended behavior.
Events are implemented for Delete, Save and Insert operations, including "after" and "before" notions for fine-grained control.


== Building from Source

You donâ€™t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 1.8.

[source,bash]
----
# get all needed Eclipse dependencies first (need only to be executed once)
$ ./mvnw clean validate -f ./spring-data-cdo-distribution/pom.xml -PfetchEclipseDependencies
# package and install the actual 'spring-data-cdo' dependency
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Pdistribute
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/site/reference/html/index.html`.
The Maven profile `distribute` is provided by `spring-data-parent`.
For more information see link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-build[https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-build] on how to set up the Asciidoc documentation.

=== Deploy

[source,bash]
----
 $ mvn package deploy -DskipTests -Pdeploy -Dusername=USERNAME -Dpassword=HASHED-PASSWORD
----
